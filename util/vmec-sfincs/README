OVERVIEW:

The m3dc1_to_vmec_sfincs.py script uses the C1.h5 output from M3D-C1 to generate:

* An imitation VMEC output file
  -- This imitation VMEC file only contains those VMEC quantities required to initialize the SFINCS neoclassical transport code, including

* (optional) SFINCS input file and temperature/density profile information in the form of a SFINCS-compatible 'runspec.dat' file

REQUIREMENTS:
- fusion-io and write_neo_input must be compiled and installed
- FIO_ROOT must be set to the location of the fusion-io repo


EXECUTION:
- The 'driver_script.py' file here includes an example of running this script
- Copy this script into the M3D-C1 output directory where the C1.h5 file is located
- Edit the driver script with desired arguments
- Then execute: 'python driver_script.py'

OUTPUTS:
- The imitation VMEC file will have a name such as 'imVMEC-*.nc'
- The SFINCS input file will be called 'input.namelist'
- The SFINCS profile information will be in a file called 'runspec.dat'
- Quantities used in the construction of the imitation VMEC file (in the form of a python dict) are stored in the pickled data file 'imVMEC_data.pkl'
